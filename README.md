# Sparse-2D-array-cpp
A solution for sparse 2D array which is an array in which most of the elements have the same value (known as the default valueâ€”usually 0 or null). The occurrence of zero elements in a large array is inefficient for both computation and storage. An array in which there is a large number of zero elements is referred to as being sparse.
